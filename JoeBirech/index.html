									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p>I'm passionate about learning, exploring, travelling and meeting new people.</p>
								</header>
								<hr/>
								<p> Born on January 1998 in small town of Eldoret in Kenya. I'm currently working on startup aimed at reducing monopoly of having a few giant internet companies such as facebook control the data of
									billions of people around the world. Our goal is to give people an option to choose not to use these sites but still have the connections to the loved ones, make new connections and share their stories online to te world.
								</p>
								<p>Raised in a business family i was exposed to the business world as a kid, buying sweets and biscuits at wholesale prices and resaling them at retail prices in my school.
									I liked how easy it was to make money from other people's product by simply buying in bulk and selling it individually so i did that through my junior studies all the way to highschool even though it was illegal
									to do business in school. After highschool i joined a network marketing company where i learned the principle of leveraging and having other people put in the work yet i still gain the profits.

									I joined a local University at the age of 17 to pursue a Bachelor's in Biological sciences but ended up dropping out three weeks into the second semester after the professor's went on a strike. A few month's later i moved 
									to USA to pursue a Bachelor's in Nursing. While on my first semester i developed an interest in programming and started learning python from codecademy. As i kept on searching for coding schools and bootcamps that were free
									i came across a coding university (42silicon valley) that was not only completely free but also offered housing for free. Did the logic tests on as part of the admission process then got selected for the one month intensive 
									coding challege in C as part of the admission process. I finally passed the admission process and secured my self a spot at the school where i dived into writing Software up to date while doing other courses from other free online education tools such as Udacity,
									Edx, Developers.google, Udemy, Hackerrank, Aga Khan and cognitiveclass.ai.

										<h2>Ambitions</h2>
										<p>Despite the awesome and quick upgrade in techonlogy in the recent decades there is more to be achived in the future.</p>
									</header>
									<hr />
									<p> My passion and Ambitions is to understand how self driving cars work, collecting data and using the data to train the cars to make better decisions. I'm a big fan of renewable energy and electric Cras.
										I look forward to a day when we'd all dump gasoline cars and embrace electric cars fully. My dream is develop an energy source that's fully dependendant on natural energy such as wind, solar or water energy.
